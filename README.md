# Calculate Discount Function ðŸ›’

## About this project
Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I made this small Python program to practice writing functions. The goal is to **calculate the discount** you get on an item based on the original price and discount percentage. This was my first attempt at writing a function that takes input, does some math, and gives an output.  

## What the code does
Hereâ€™s what happens in the program:

1. It asks the user for the original price of an item.
2. It asks the user for the discount percentage.
3. It calculates the discounted price.
4. It prints out the final price after discount.  

Itâ€™s simple, but it helped me understand **how functions work and how to get input from users**.  

## How to run it
1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3 recommended).  
2. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lynn004/calculate-discount-function.git
